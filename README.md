# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program
This repository documents my week-by-week progress in the VSD SoC Tapeout Program — India’s largest open-source RISC-V tapeout initiative.

🏁 *Welcome to My SoC Tapeout Journey (VSD)*

💡 **Program Goal**:

Learn how to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from scratch — taking it from RTL design all the way to GDSII (final layout) — using a fully open-source ASIC flow.

📚 About the Program

This hands-on program is part of a nationwide effort to build India's semiconductor ecosystem, empowering 3500+ participants to create working silicon chips using:

Open-Source EDA Tools

RISC-V Architecture

Collaborative Design Methodology

Through this journey, I will:

Understand the RTL-to-GDSII flow step by step.

Learn and practice with industry-standard PDKs and toolchains.

Gain hands-on experience with RTL design, synthesis, floorplanning, placement & routing, and final tapeout preparation.
