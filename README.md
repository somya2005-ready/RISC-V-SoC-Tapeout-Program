# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program
This repository documents my week-by-week progress in the VSD SoC Tapeout Program — India’s largest open-source RISC-V tapeout initiative.

🏁 Welcome to My SoC Tapeout Journey (VSD)

💡 Program Goal:
Learn how to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from scratch — taking it from RTL design all the way to GDSII (final layout) — using a fully open-source ASIC flow.
