Task 1 : 
Notes on 1st lecture :"Dgital VLSI SoC [Semiconductor On Chip ] Design & Planning "

Chip Modelling :
A Chip Taped out by VSD : VSDSquadron

*VSDSquadron :VSDSquadron, a cutting-edge development board based on the RISC-V architecture that is fully open-source. This board presents an exceptional opportunity for individuals to learn about RISC-V and VLSI chip design utilizing only open-source tools, starting from the RTL and extending all the way to the GDSII.
